# INLAjoint Docker Web Application

A comprehensive Dockerized R Shiny web application for joint modeling using the INLAjoint package. This application provides an intuitive interface for fitting joint longitudinal and survival models with advanced data handling and enhanced package loading capabilities.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

This application is built upon the excellent **INLAjoint** package developed by **Dr. Denis Rustand**. The INLAjoint package provides state-of-the-art Bayesian joint modeling capabilities using the INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) approach.

- **Original INLAjoint Package**: Dr. Denis Rustand
- **Package Repository**: https://github.com/DenisRustand/INLAjoint
- **Docker Web Application**: GitHub Copilot (based on user requirements)

We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Rustand's outstanding contribution to the joint modeling community and his work in making advanced Bayesian joint models accessible to researchers worldwide.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- At least 4GB RAM recommended for optimal performance
- Port 3838 available (or modify in docker-compose.yml)

### üöÄ Launch the Application

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine
2. **Navigate** to the project directory in your terminal
3. **Build and run** the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the application** at: `http://localhost:3838`

### üéØ Quick Test with Sample Data

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Navigate to the **"Data Input"** tab
3. Select **"Sample Data"** from the data source options
4. Choose a sample dataset (e.g., "Longitudinal MS Data")
5. Click **"Load Sample Data"**
6. Go to **"Model Configuration"** and click **"Run Model"**
7. View results in the **"Results"** tab

## Enhanced Package Loading System

The application implements a sophisticated three-tier loading system to ensure it works in any environment:

### Tier 1: Standard Package Installation
```r
# Attempts normal package installation
library(INLAjoint)
library(INLA)
```

### Tier 2: Enhanced Source Loading
```r
# If package installation fails, loads from source
source("utils/enhanced_inlajoint.R")
# Sources all INLAjoint functions directly from GitHub
# Provides full functionality when INLA is available
```

### Tier 3: Mock Implementation
```r
# If both above fail, provides realistic mock functions
source("utils/mock_inla.R")
# Generates realistic results for demonstration and testing
# Allows users to explore the interface without INLA
```

This ensures that:
- ‚úÖ **Researchers with INLA** get full functionality
- ‚úÖ **Users without INLA** can still explore and learn
- ‚úÖ **Demonstration environments** work reliably
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD pipelines** don't break due to package issues
- Prepare your longitudinal and survival data in CSV format
## Detailed Usage Guide

### 1. Data Input Options

#### üìÅ CSV File Upload
Perfect for local datasets, one-time analyses, and quick prototyping:
1. Prepare your data in CSV format (see format requirements below)
2. Use the file upload interface in the "Data Input" tab
3. Preview your data to verify correct loading
4. Specify ID and time variables for longitudinal data

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection
Perfect for large datasets, production environments, and automated workflows:
- **PostgreSQL** (recommended for large datasets)
- **MySQL/MariaDB**
- **SQLite** (good for local development)

Steps:
1. Enter connection details in the database configuration panel
2. Test connection to verify accessibility
3. Write SQL queries to extract your data
4. Preview results before loading into the model

#### üìä Sample Datasets
Perfect for learning, testing, and demonstrations:
- **Longitudinal MS Data**: Multiple sclerosis progression data
- **Simulated Longitudinal**: Generated data with known parameters
- **Survival MS Data**: Time-to-event outcomes
- **Simulated Survival**: Generated survival data

### 2. Model Configuration

The application provides both **guided** and **advanced** formula entry:

**Guided Mode** (Recommended for beginners):
- Point-and-click variable selection
- Automatic syntax generation
- Real-time validation
- Example formulas for reference

**Advanced Mode** (For experienced users):
- Direct R formula syntax entry
- Full flexibility for complex models
- Syntax highlighting and validation
- Custom function support

## Data Format Requirements

### Longitudinal Data Structure
```csv
id,time,outcome,treatment,age,sex
1,0,10.2,1,65,F
1,6,12.1,1,65,F
1,12,13.5,1,65,F
2,0,9.8,0,58,M
2,6,11.2,0,58,M
2,12,10.5,0,58,M
```

**Required columns**:
- `id`: Subject identifier (numeric or character)
- `time`: Time point (numeric, 0 = baseline)
- `outcome`: Longitudinal outcome (numeric)

### Survival Data Structure
```csv
id,time_to_event,event,treatment,age,sex
1,18.5,1,1,65,F
2,24.0,0,0,58,M
3,12.3,1,1,72,F
```

**Required columns**:
- `id`: Subject identifier (must match longitudinal data)
- `time_to_event`: Time to event or censoring (numeric)
- `event`: Event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### üîß Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Port 3838 already in use"
```bash
# Solution 1: Stop existing containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up

# Solution 2: Use different port
# Edit docker-compose.yml: "3839:3838"
```

#### "INLA package not available"
```
‚úÖ Expected behavior: App automatically switches to enhanced mode
‚úÖ Check logs: Look for "Using enhanced INLAjoint loader" message
‚úÖ Verify functionality: Mock results should still be generated
```

#### "Database connection failed"
```bash
# Check database service
docker-compose logs postgres

# Verify credentials in docker-compose.yml
# Default: testuser/testpass/testdb
```

#### "Model fitting takes too long"
1. Use sample data for initial testing
2. Reduce data size for complex models
3. Simplify model specification
4. Check available memory (4GB+ recommended)
